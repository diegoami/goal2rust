# goal2rust

A Rust translation of the match engine of *goal (version 2)* (1993), for speed, checked routine by
routine against [goal2-archaeology](https://github.com/diegoami/goal2-archaeology)'s accepted Python
port and, through it, the original. Rules: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). No byte of the original game is here.

Build, state/tables API and backend-worker isolation: [engine/README.md](engine/README.md).
The translation sequence is in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md); current sealed-engine
state-v2 compatibility evidence is in [out/T07](out/T07/README.md), with the
historical baseline in [out/T03](out/T03/README.md). The first native
caller/callee tree is documented in [out/T04](out/T04/README.md). The native
nearest-to-ball tree is in [out/T05](out/T05/README.md), and effective skill
in [out/T06](out/T06/README.md). Common-bridge performance evidence and
baseline/confirmation rules are in [out/T08](out/T08/README.md). Read the latest
[checkpoint](https://github.com/diegoami/goal2rust/issues/1) before restarting work.

The complete chase-gate subtree is now native: [T20 results](out/T20/assessment.md).
The profile confirms 51 native bodies and 81.92% native guest entries on the reference
fixture. Three paired rounds use 4.16% less CPU than saved T19. In that same
campaign, saved T19 uses 25.17% less CPU than PyPy and T20 uses 28.29% less.
This is a partial engine port and one-fixture result; whole-engine and application
gates remain in the roadmap. No next task is included.
